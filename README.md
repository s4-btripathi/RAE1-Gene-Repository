# Lab 15: My Gene-Repository
Hi. Welcome to my repository! This serves as an outline for my research term paper for evolution RAE 1 Gene within the deuterostomes. It consists of procedures, tools and commands I used to obtain the results I got. 

# Part 1 - Create a Directory
To begin working on the gene analysis, lets create directory where we can input all of the information that is realted to the gene RAE1. Use the command to create a directory. 
```bash
mkdir /home/ec2-user/RAE1
```
Following command will create a directory in ec2-user folder in your readme. 

# Part 2 - Downloading RAE1 gene from NCBI Blast database
